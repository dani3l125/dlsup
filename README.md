This repository consisits models implementations, training pipline and inference script we used for our deep learning course final project. 

Detailed explanations about the code can be found in the pdf that was sent to you by mail.

To run the ```inference.py``` script, the model .pth file from the drive should be placed in the repository cloned folder. You can change the ```video_inference```
function call at the end of the script to ```inference``` for a visualization of the validation set samples.
